      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I am a BTech student specializing in IoT — a field integrating hardware and software technologies.
        With an engineering background and strong research skills, I have team spirit and I am committed to submit my
        work in the given time. I was one of the top heads leading the team of over 130 members for a national level
        fest in
        college, Tulsi Mahotsav. Also, I have managed many events as an organiser and a part of two top literary clubs
        in college.
        As a college fresher, I had also served as the first CR of my class, therefore I understand accountability and
        responsibility.
        I had also learnt the basics of Indian Classical music to understand voice and tone precisely. I am comfortable
        managing a large
        audience on stage as I have done anchoring in many school and college level events. Apart from all these, I have
        an interest in
        exploring rich culture and history of different places and learning about them. Below, I have provided links to all the 
        relevant certificates available currently.
